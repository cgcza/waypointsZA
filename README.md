Gliding waypoints and turnpoints for glider pilots flying in the Cape, South Africa.

### Goals:

1. One, [single point of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth)
for [waypoints](https://xkcd.com/927/), locations, unique short codes, and descriptions.
2. Version controlled, with full history.
3. Open source, open data, including all history, versions, changes, and motivations.
4. Anybody can contribute (and anybody can fork).
5. Automatically incorporated into XCSoar, Oudie, etc.

### :south_africa: Instructions :south_africa:

To use the waypoint file on your glide computer (that supports CUP files):

1. Download or copy the 
[South_Africa_Cape.cup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csindle/waypointsZA/master/South_Africa_Cape.cup)
file to the correct location.
2. Activate it.

(In future, we will have official time based releases, to ensure strict version synchronisation. 
E.g. `South_Africa_Cape_v2021-12-07.cup`).

### Contributor Instructions

*We explicitly welcome contributions, comments, requests, and suggestions.*

To edit the waypoints immediately:

1. Click on [`South_Africa_Cape.cup`](South_Africa_Cape.cup) file. 
2. Click on the pencil icon in the top right corner.
3. Modify the file as necessary, try to keep changes to a single function or turnpoint so that a history is easily viewable.
4. At the bottom of the page, write a quick summary of changes. E.g. "Deleted duplicate waypoint." and click "Propose changes".
5. Click "Create pull request" (twice). 
6. A maintainer with write access to the master branch can then approve and merge changes.

### Maintainer Instructions

#### Convert CSV (spreadsheet) ðŸ ª CUP:

1. Download the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13YJ6NrfoLhxTgeO8fi1aIT0n_nm4z0_ixXWjndgwzjE/edit#gid=364570956)
as a CSV file (and rename to something sane like `South_Africa_Cape.cup.csv`).
2. Remove all Columns after K and save. I.e. keep only the first 11 columns 
(`name,code,country,lat,lon,elev,style,rwdir,rwlen,freq,desc`).
3. Run:
    `./script/sanitise.py South_Africa_Cape.cup.csv South_Africa_Cape.cup` to create the verified output `.cup` file.
    (Requires `HEAD` version of [aerofiles](https://github.com/csindle/aerofiles).)
4. Rename output file appropriately and commit, push, and publish.

#### Convert CUP ðŸ ª KML (Google Earth):

1. Run:
    `gpsbabel -i xcsv,style=script/name_cup.style -f South_Africa_Cape.cup  -o kml -F South_Africa_Cape.cup.kml`
   (Requires [`gpsbabel`](https://www.gpsbabel.org/).)
2. Import the KML file as a new layer on the 
    [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1OdQ9Jp9IcUgXAMa7qQpaBRQReOhAuitc&usp=sharing) layer.
3. Rename, and delete the old layer.
